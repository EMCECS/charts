# Dell EMC Common Kubernetes Support

This Helm chart deploys a controller [decks] capable of watching Application Resources and Kubernetes Events. Its purpose is take a gateway request, verify the availability of a gateway, create the resource, and watch for updates to the gateway resource.

## Description

DECKS includes a Kubernetes deployment that manage DECKS controller.

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment decks
NAME   DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
decks   1         1         1            1           70m
```

## Requirements

* A [Helm](https://helm.sh) installation with access to install to one or more namespaces.

## Quick Start

1. First, [install and setup Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart).  *_Note:_* you'll likely need to setup role-based access controls for Helm to have rights to install packages, so be sure to read that part.

2. Setup the [EMCECS Helm Repository](https://github.com/EMCECS/charts).

```bash
$ helm repo add ecs https://emcecs.github.io/charts
$ helm repo update
```

3. Install the DECKS. This allows you to start watching the Kubernetes Application resources as well as Kubernetes Events.

```bash
$ helm install --name decks ecs/decks
NAME:  decks
...
```

There are [configuration options](#configuration) you can peruse later at your heart's delight.

## Configuration

### Namespace Access

DECKS can be configured to manage a single namespace within a Kubernetes cluster, or all namespaces. To configure a specific namespace, simply set the `global.watchNamespace` setting:

```bash
$ helm install --name decks \
    --set global.watchNamespace=my-namespace \
    ecs/decks
```

To use the decks with any namespace on the Kubernetes cluster, you can retain the default configuration, which is to set the `global.watchNamespace` setting to an empty string (`""`).

### Private Docker Registry

While the ECS Flex container images are hosted publicly, DECKS also supports configuration of a private Docker registry for offline Kubernetes clusters or those that do not have access to public registries. To configure a private registry:

1. Download the DECKS container image from [support.emc.com] and upload the images to your private registry.

_*TODO: Add download link once available*_

2. Add a Kubernetes secret for the [private Docker registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod)

```bash
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry decks-registry \
    --docker-username=<DOCKER_USERNAME> \
    --docker-password=<DOCKER_PASSWORD> \
    --docker-email=<DOCKER_EMAIL>
```

3. Set the registry secret and location in the Helm chart installations  via Helm:

```bash
helm install \
    --set global.registry=<REGISTRY ADDRESS> \
    --set global.registrySecret=<SECRET_NAME> \
    ecs/decks
```
4. Verify whether DECKS is installed successfully and working as expected. The "helm test <release-name>" instantiate a test-app which instantiate a sample SRS Gateway object to verify that it registers to the SRS gateway successfully, and do the home test, and  assign extenal IP address for the remote access and it is reachable on port 22. "kubectl logs <release-name>-deck-test should show that the output logs.

```bash
helm test <release-name>
