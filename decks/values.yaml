# We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
# choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
# resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
# lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
resources: {}
# limits:
#  cpu: 100m
#  memory: 128Mi
# requests:
#  cpu: 100m
