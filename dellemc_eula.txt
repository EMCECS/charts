Commercial Terms of Sale 
(United States)
These Commercial Terms of Sale (“CTS”) apply to orders for hardware, software, and services by direct commercial and public sector purchasers and to commercial end-users who purchase through a reseller (“Customer”), unless Customer and Suppliers (defined below) have entered into a separate written agreement that applies to Customer’s orders for specific products or services, in which case, the separate written agreement governs Customer’s purchase and use of such specific products or services.
The term “Suppliers” means, as applicable:
EMC Corporation (“EMC”)
176 South Street
Hopkinton, Massachusetts 01748
or
Dell Marketing L.P. (“Dell”)
One Dell Way
Round Rock, Texas 78682

Customer may buy or license Products, buy Services, or both, from one or both Suppliers under the CTS, or from an Affiliate that provides Customer a quote referencing the CTS. The General Terms below apply to Suppliers and to Affiliates who provide products and services pursuant to the CTS, unless stated otherwise. The Supplier or Affiliate that issues the quote to Customer is solely responsible to Customer to fulfill the obligations under that quote. 
Telemetry Collector
This Collector gathers system information related to this machine, such as diagnostics, configurations, usage characteristics, performance, and deployment location (collectively, “System Data”), and it manages the remote access and the exchange of the System Data with Dell Inc. or its applicable subsidiaries (together, “Dell”). This Collector is Dell Confidential Information and you may not provide or share it with others. Other than enabling the Collector to run, you do not have a license to use it. By enabling the Collector, Customer consents to Dell’s connection to and remote access of the product containing the Collector and acknowledges that Dell will use the System Data transmitted to Dell via the Collector as follows (“Permitted Purposes”):
• remotely access the product and Collector to install, maintain, monitor, remotely support, receive alerts and notifications from, and change certain internal system parameters of this product and the Customer’s environment, in fulfillment of applicable warranty and support obligations;
• provide Customer with visibility to its actual usage and consumption patterns of the product;
• utilize the System Data in connection with predictive analytics and usage intelligence to consult with and assist Customer, directly or through a reseller, to optimize Customer’s future planning activities and requirements; and
• “anonymize” (i.e., remove any reference to a specific Customer) and aggregate System Data with that from products of other Customers and use such data to develop and improve products.

Customer may disable the Collector at any time, in which case all the above activities will stop. Customer acknowledges that this will limit Dell’s ability and obligations (if any) to support the product.

The Collector does not enable Dell or their service personnel to access, view, process, copy, modify, or handle Customer’s business data stored on or in this product. System Data does not include personally identifiable data relating to any individuals.
