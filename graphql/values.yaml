logReceiver:
  # The type of log receiver that ECS Flex will use to consolidate logs. Valid
  # are: "Syslog" and "Elasticsearch".  When using a "Syslog" receiver, you can
  # optionally instruct ECS Flex to create a syslog receiver.  In the case of
  # Elasticsearch, the administrator is expected to create the cluster, and then
  # provide connectivity details in the "logReceiver" configuration block below.
  #
  # type: Syslog

  # User login will be used by fluentd to connect to the elastic search.
  # user: elastic

  # Password will be used by fluentd to connect to the elsatic search.
  # password: 123456

  # Configure an external Syslog or Elasticsearch hostname to receive logs from
  # ECS instances
  # host: my-syslog-server
  #
  # Configure protocol to receive logs for a Syslog-based receiver. Valid values
  # for syslog receivers are "tcp". Valid values for Elasticsearch are
  # "http" and "https"
  # protocol: tcp

  # Port to use for customer provided Syslog or Elasticsearch receiver

  # The ObjectScale operator can deploy an rSyslog receiver to aggregate logs from
  # ECS instances. This feature is recommended for enterprise support of ECS
