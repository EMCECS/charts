Congratulations! You've deployed Mongoose.  A horizontally scalable, high
performance and extensively configurable S3 load testing tool.

To start viewing your load-test results, simply follow the logs of the controller
pod:

    kubectl logs -f `kubectl get pod --no-headers -l name={{ .Release.Name }}-controller | head -1 | cut -d " " -f1`
