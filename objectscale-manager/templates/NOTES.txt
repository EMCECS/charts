Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}. This release is capable of
deploying and upgrading Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Clusters for a
highly scalable, private, S3-compatible object storage.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

{{- if .Values.vSpherePlugin.enabled }}
Congratulations! You've enabled the vSphere Plugin, so you can manage this installation
directly from vCenter.  To enable the plug-in, add your vCenter details with these
environment variables:

VC_ADDRESS=<address and port of vCenter>
VC_USERNAME=<username of vCenter admin user>
VC_PASSWORD=<password of vCenter admin user>
PLUGIN_ADDR=$(kubectl get svc objectscale-vsphere-plugin -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')

Then from the this Helm chart directory (charts/{{ .Chart.Name }}):

./scripts/extension-registration.sh \
    -action registerPlugin \
    -remote \
    -url https://${VC_ADDRESS}/sdk \
    -username ${VC_USERNAME} \
    -password ${VC_PASSWORD} \
    -key com.vmware.sample.docker \
    -version {{ .Chart.AppVersion }} \
    -pluginUrl https:///${PLUGIN_ADDR}/plugin.json \
    -serverThumbprint 1a:8c:e0:17:57:46:a6:4c:5d:97:29:b8:f3:02:9c:b3:43:90:60:f9 \
    -c 'Docker, Inc.' \
    -n 'ECS-FLEX-UI-AARON-DOCKER' \
    -s 'Testing ECS Flex plugin Docker'

You can then check plugin deployment status from vCenter under:

    Home -> Administration -> Solutions -> Client Plugins

Once deployed, you can manage object stores from:

    Hosts and Clusters -> <Your Cluster Name> -> Configure -> ObjectScale -> Object Stores

Enjoy!
