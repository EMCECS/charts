# We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a
# conscious choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on
# environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to
# specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary,
# and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
resources:
# limits:
#  ephemeral-storage: 10Gi
# requests:
#  ephemeral-storage: 20Gi
