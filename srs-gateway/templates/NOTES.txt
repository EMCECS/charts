Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}. This release is capable of
deploying an SRS Gateway Custom Resource (CR) and all of its secondary
resources.


Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To install an SRS Gateway CR by using Helm chart, use the helm install
command below:

  $ helm install <repository name>/srs-gateway --set gateway.hostname=<fqdn-or-ip> --set product=<product>

The product must be a product/model that has been "on-boarded" into the SRS
system (e.g. "OBJECTSCALE"), and must be a product/model that is recognized
by the SRS gateway that you are using.

For more information on the installation and configuration options, see the
README at https://github.com/EMCECS/charts/tree/master/srs-gateway and the
`values.yaml` file at
