# Required and default values for the SRS gateway Custom Resource
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# The name to use for the SRS GW custom resource Kubernetes object. If set,
# this name will be used as a prefix for all secondary resources generated
# for the SRS GW custom resource. This allows for multiple SRS GW custom
# resources to use the same product name, while providing distinct names
# for the SRS GW CRs and their corresponding secondary resources.
#
# This explicit setting for resource name is provided primarily for testing.
# Production setups should leave this unset.
#
# If "customResourceName" is not set, the lowercase version of the "product"
# setting will be used for the name of the SRS GW CR as well as a name prefix
# for all secondary resources.
# customResourceName: "objectscale"

namespace: "default"

# ==================== MANDATORY SETTING ====================
# Product must be an "on-boarded" product/model name recognized by SRS
# product: "OBJECTSCALE"
# ===========================================================
 
# The default docker registry, tag and pull policy for the remote access and
# notifier pods that are created as SRS gateway CR secondary resources.
registry: "emccorp"
tag: "stable"
pullPolicy: "Always"

# Name to use for SRS credentials secret
# credsSecretName: objectscale-srs-creds-secret

gateway:
  # ==================== MANDATORY SETTING ====================
  # The gateway hostname can be an IP address or an FQDN
  # hostname: "10.249.253.18"
  # ===========================================================

  # Port that the SRS Gateway is listening on for RESTful API requests.
  port: 9443

  # The resource name to use for the credentials secret. If this is not set,
  # then the name of the credentials secret will be derived from either the
  # "customResourceName" or "product" settings. The precedence for creds
  # secret name selection is as follows:
  # - Use the explicit "credsSecretName" if set,
  # - OR, use the "customResourceName" as a basis, if set, with the format:
  #           <customResourceName>-srs-creds-secret
  # - OR, use the "product" (required) setting, with the format:
  #           <product>-srs-creds-secret
  # credsSecretName: "objectscale-srs-creds-secret"
